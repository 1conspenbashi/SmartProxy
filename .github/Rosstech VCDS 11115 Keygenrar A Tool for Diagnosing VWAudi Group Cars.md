VCDS is a Windows-based program that connects to the car via an interface cable. It can perform various tasks such as reading and clearing fault codes, displaying live data, performing output tests, coding and adapting modules, resetting service reminders, and more. It supports all VW-Audi Group cars from 1990 to the current model year, and is constantly updated with new features and compatibility.
 
Rosstech VCDS 11115 Keygenrar is a modified version of VCDS that includes a keygen (key generator) that allows users to activate the software without purchasing a license from Ross-Tech. This version of VCDS also claims to have some additional functions and enhancements that are not available in the official version. However, it is not authorized or endorsed by Ross-Tech, and may not work properly or safely with some cars or modules. It may also contain viruses or malware that could harm your computer or your car.
 
Therefore, we do not recommend using Rosstech VCDS 11115 Keygenrar or any other pirated or hacked version of VCDS. If you want to use VCDS for your car, you should purchase a genuine interface and software from Ross-Tech or one of their authorized distributors. This way, you can ensure that you have the latest and most reliable version of VCDS, and that you have access to technical support and warranty from Ross-Tech. You can also avoid any legal or ethical issues that may arise from using unauthorized software.

In this article, we will explain some of the main features and functions of VCDS and how it can help you diagnose and repair your car. We will also show you some examples of how to use VCDS to perform common tasks such as reading fault codes, checking live data, and coding modules.
 
One of the most useful features of VCDS is the ability to read and clear fault codes from all the control modules in your car. Fault codes are stored in the modules when they detect a problem or malfunction in the system. They can help you identify the cause and location of the problem, and suggest possible solutions. To read fault codes with VCDS, you need to connect the interface cable to the car's diagnostic port, usually located under the dashboard. Then, you need to start the VCDS program on your computer and select [Auto-Scan]. This will scan all the modules in your car and display a list of fault codes for each module. You can then click on each module to see more details about the fault codes, such as their description, frequency, and freeze frame data. You can also save or print the scan results for future reference. To clear fault codes, you need to select [Clear Codes - 05] for each module.
 
Another useful feature of VCDS is the ability to display live data from various sensors and actuators in your car. Live data are real-time values that show the current status and operation of the system. They can help you monitor the performance and condition of your car, and troubleshoot any problems or anomalies. To display live data with VCDS, you need to select [Measuring Blocks - 08] for the module you want to access. This will show you a list of available measuring blocks for that module. You can then select up to four measuring blocks to display on the screen. You can also use [Advanced Measuring Values] to search for specific measuring blocks by name or group number. You can view the live data in numerical or graphical format, and record or log them for later analysis.
 
A third useful feature of VCDS is the ability to code and adapt modules to change their settings and functions. Coding is a process of modifying the binary values stored in the module's memory that determine its configuration and behavior. Adapting is a process of changing the values of specific parameters that affect the module's operation. Coding and adapting can help you customize your car to your preferences and needs, or enable or disable certain features or options. To code or adapt modules with VCDS, you need to select [Coding - 07] or [Adaptation - 10] for the module you want to modify. This will show you a screen where you can enter or change the coding or adaptation values. You can also use [Long Coding Helper] or [Channel Map] to assist you with finding and changing the correct values. You should always make a backup of your original coding or adaptation values before making any changes, and only change values that you understand and are sure of their effects.
