#### Summary
SmartProxy is a Firefox/Chrome extension based on WebExtensions/Chrome Extensions.

Use patterns to automatically define rules for proxify your web experience. With SmartProxy, you don't need to change your proxy manually and turn it on and off. You can add your desired website to the proxy rules list with just one click. After that, when you visit that specific website, SmartProxy will act and all you data for that website will be transferred though the proxy, without you doing anything.

What's more, SmartProxy is inspired by AutoProxy and AutoProxy-ng and that are now considered legacy. SmartProxy is completely written from ground up using WebExtensions and provides same and even more functionality than those proxies.
