# How to Download and Install 3DeSmuME, a High-Resolution 3D Nintendo DS Emulator
 
3DeSmuME is a fork of DeSmuME, the most seasoned open source Nintendo DS emulator. It sports tools designed for hackers, speedrunners, youtubers, and casual gamers. 3DeSmuME adds support for high-resolution 3D rendering, which allows you to increase the 3D resolution beyond the native resolution of 256Ã192 pixels. This can make your games look sharper and more detailed on modern screens.

In this article, we will show you how to download and install 3DeSmuME on your Windows or Mac computer. You will also need some Nintendo DS ROMs to play with the emulator, which you can legally obtain from your own cartridges or online sources.
 
## Step 1: Download 3DeSmuME
 
The latest stable release of 3DeSmuME is version 0.9.13, which was released on May 23rd, 2022. You can download it from the official GitHub page[^1^] or from SourceForge[^3^]. Choose the version that matches your operating system and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
 
If you are using Windows, you will also need to install the â2015, 2017, and 2019â³ redistributable[^1^], which is required to run the emulator. If you are using Mac, you will need to install the BizHawk prerequisite installer[^1^], which contains some libraries that the emulator depends on.
 
## Step 2: Extract and Run 3DeSmuME
 
After downloading the emulator, you will need to extract it from the zip file. You can use any file archiver program, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip for Windows, or The Unarchiver for Mac. Once extracted, you will see a folder named âdesmume-x.x.xâ, where x.x.x is the version number.
 
Inside the folder, you will find an executable file named âdesmume.exeâ for Windows or âDeSmuME.appâ for Mac. Double-click on it to run the emulator. You should see a window with two screens, representing the top and bottom screens of the Nintendo DS.
 
## Step 3: Load a Nintendo DS ROM
 
To play a game with 3DeSmuME, you will need a Nintendo DS ROM file, which is a digital copy of the game cartridge. You can legally dump your own cartridges using a device such as R4i Save Dongle or NDS Backup Adapter Plus. Alternatively, you can download ROMs from online sources, but make sure you own the original games and follow the laws of your country.
 
To load a ROM, go to File > Open ROM in the emulator menu and browse to the location of your ROM file. Select it and click Open. The game should start running on the emulator screens. You can use your keyboard or a gamepad to control the game.
 
## Step 4: Enable High-Resolution 3D Rendering
 
By default, 3DeSmuME renders the 3D graphics at the native resolution of 256Ã192 pixels. However, you can increase this resolution by using the âGPU Scaling Factorâ feature[^2^]. This feature allows you to scale up the 3D resolution by a factor of 2x, 4x, or higher.
 
To enable this feature, go to Config > Display Method in the emulator menu and choose OpenGL (New). Then go to Config > GPU Scaling Factor and choose a factor that suits your preference and performance. The higher the factor, the sharper and more detailed the graphics will be, but also more demanding on your computer.
 
You can also adjust other settings related to graphics quality and performance in Config > Emulation Settings > GPU tab. For example, you can enable anti-aliasing, texture filtering, texture scaling, etc.
 
## Step 5: Enjoy Your Games
 
Thatâs it! You have successfully downloaded and installed 3DeSmuME and enabled high-resolution 3D rendering. Now you can enjoy
